### Branches
Branches are a way to work on different versions of a project at the same time. They allow you to create a separate line of development that can be worked on independently of the main branch. This can be useful when you want to make changes to a project without affecting the main branch or when you want to work on a new feature or bug fix.

```
git branch
git branch bug-fix
git switch bug-fix
git log
git switch master
git switch -c dark-mode
git checkout orange-mode

```
